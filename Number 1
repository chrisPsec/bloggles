#### In Which I Flail About: The Blog
###### _Collecting parts for my new engine_

Here I am (currently that's near the Arctic Circle), nearly paralyzed by the impression my new professional pursuit has made upon me. Its scope is not monstrously huge, but its many small parts remind me of a broken brass [pocket watch](https://www.flickr.com/photos/perrylens/3835038045/) my father gave me years ago: layered, intricate, complex - almost too complex at first glance, but surely sense can be made of it, with time.

What am I wringing my hands about, then? Who am I? Why would I believe anyone would even read this? What new engine?

I'll start with the engine. I'm somewhat of a car nut - my current project is a [1984 Volvo 245 GLT](http://forums.turbobricks.com/showthread.php?t=312359).  Though I'm not as deeply entrenched as a mechanical engineer working for NASCAR, and not quite as knowledgeable as an [ASE](https://www.ase.com/Home.aspx) certified master technician, I am a nut nonetheless. I particularly delight in the inner (and outer) workings of engines - reciprocating movement translated to rotary movement, converted into thrust? Awesome.  What I'm getting at is that I liken my current brain-training to building up an engine, and once it's complete, I can then plunk it down into the vehicle of my choosing - eventually a career in infosec.

That's what I'm wringing my hands about. I must remind myself that I'll get there, one task at a time. With the completion of this entry, I think I can say I've learned Markdown (at least enough for making a blog).  Next, I'll start digging into the Atom text editor, which I'm currently using to write. A close friend of mine has offered to recommend some packages and guide me through their potential uses, which I may play with in my next entry. Also worth noting is my usage of GitHub to host the markdown text for these entries (I'm totally new to git and GitHub), and to build the site where they'll be published, via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Neat stuff.

- brief bio
- would I read me? maybe...if I was beating my head against the mountain of info orbiting around the red giant star that is infosec - there are a few of these out there, so surely this can't be that interesting. I'm selfish, however, so I'll admit this is mostly to help me chronicle my learning, while also wrapping my head around Atom and markdown (neat stuff!)
