#### In Which I Flail About: The Blog
###### _Collecting parts for my new engine_

Here I am (currently that's near the Arctic Circle), nearly stricken by the impression my new professional pursuit has made upon me. Its scope is not monstrously huge. Its many small parts remind me of the broken Elgin pocket watch my father gave me: layered, intricate, complex - daunting at first glance, but surely sense can be made of it all.

What am I wringing my hands about, then? Who am I? Why would I believe anyone would even read this? What engine?

(notes):
- learning markdown, atom, and the intricacies of Github, dipping my toes into the infosec world
- brief bio
- would I read me? maybe...if I was beating my head against the mountain of info orbiting around the red giant star that is infosec - there are a few of these out there, so surely this can't be that interesting. I'm selfish, however, so I'll admit this is mostly to help me chronicle my learning, while also wrapping my head around Atom and markdown (neat stuff!)
- make weak-ass comparison between engine building and me building my brain-engine to do more/better things
